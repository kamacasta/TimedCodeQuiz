# TimedCodeQuiz

## Description 
A short and fun timed code quiz, the quiz itself works and time is properly decremented when question is answered incorrectly, but I was having trouble with the scoreboard page working I think it would have been eaiser if I used a anchor tag for the scoreboard page, but the record time and initials of the quizer comes up in local storage!

```what I need to do```
in my scoreboard.js get localstorage item and make a loop!
have the correct and inccorrect notify properly!
had to comment out window.location on the submit button at the end of the quiz due to the fact data not going over to the scoreboard, I had to create an array and put the remaining time and initials in the array!
